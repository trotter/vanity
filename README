Vanity is an app that lets you be your truly vain self. Run it on the command
line to monitor how popular you are. It will pull data from your twitter and
github accounts. If they both have the same login, you can just use "vanity.rb
USERNAME" as the command. If they're different, use the command line flags of
"--github" or "--twitter" to specify the login for the respective service.

Example:
$ ruby lib/vanity.rb cashion --github=trotter
